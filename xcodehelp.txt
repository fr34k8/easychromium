Be aware, this download takes forever (>= 5 hours). You will need an Apple Developer account (free) to sign in.

You should use curl from the command line to download XCode since it permits resuming from partial downloads,
and is faster.

After signing in to the Apple developer site, export your cookies to the folder you want to download 
XCode into and name them "cookies.txt" Then, use the following command:

curl --cookie cookies.txt -O -C - http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.2/Xcode_7.2.dmg

--cookie cookies.txt: tells curl to look in cookies.txt for cookies
-O: tells curl to name the output file identically to its name on the remote host (so we'll save this file as Xcode_7.2.dmg)
-C : (note the space after the C) tells curl to resume automatically from the last point in the file, the space indicates
we want curl to figure out the byte offset instead of specifying one ourselves
- url: (note the space after the -) tells curl where to fetch the file from
